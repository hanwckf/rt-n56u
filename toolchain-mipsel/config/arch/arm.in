      Set up the toolchain so that it generates EABI-compliant binaries.
      
      If you say 'n' here, then the toolchain will generate OABI binaries.

      Is you say 'y' here, then the tuple for the toolchain will end
      up with *eabihf, instead of the usual *eabi.

      *eabihf is used to denote that the toolchain *is* using the
      hard-float ABI, while *eabi is just an indication of using the
      soft-float ABI.

      Ie. all one can say is:  *eabihf ⊢ hard-float ABI

      Saying 'n' here does *not* impact the ability of the toolchain to
      generate hard-float instructions with the hard-float ABI. It is a
      purely cosmetic thing, used by distros to differentiate their
      hard-float-ABI-using ports from their soft-float-ABI-using ports.
      (eg. Debian Wheezy and above).

      This is an option, as not all versions of gcc/binutils do support
      such tuple, and fail to build with *eabihf. Stock gcc version up
      to, and including 4.7.2 have an issue or another with *eabihf.

      This option is here for the future.

      Say 'n', unless you are trying to fix gcc to properly recognise
      the *eabihf tuples.
