    help
      It is highly recommended to check the newly built companion libraries.
      Unfortunately, this is a very intensive task, and takes a loooong time.
      
      Checking the newly built companion libraries is thus disabled by default,
      but it is suggested that you check them at least once on your machine,
      and if they work, disable the check on subsequent builds.
      
      If you suspect that one (or more) of your companion libraries is the
      cause for incorrectly generated code, you should answer 'Y' here.
      Note however that this will take a really long time.

# FIXME this needs to have a list of options
# [ ] libfoo for build
# [ ] libfoo for host (if canadian)
# [ ] libfoo for target
#     libfoo options -->
#
# Then have other packages *set default* for build/host
# (but not select, so that user can utilize build's or host's system library)
# and *select* the target (so that we build it if we must, and let user optionally
# build it if he wants). Upon any of these options LIBFOO_{BUILD,HOST,TARGET}
# being set, set LIBFOO_ENABLED and use that as a qualifier for submenu.
# For now, LIBFOO_NEEDED symbol may or may not user-selectable, and COMP_LIBS_LIBFOO
# determines whether it is actually built. LIBFOO_NEEDED is currently for build/host
# and LIBFOO_TARGET (if exists) is for target.
