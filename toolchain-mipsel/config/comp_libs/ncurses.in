# ncurses config file

config NCURSES_NEW_ABI
    bool "ncurses 6.0 ABI support"
    depends on EXPERIMENTAL
    help
      This option allows you to use the new ncurses-6 ABI.
      It's wise to leave this disabled and stick with the ncurses-5 ABI!

config NCURSES_HOST_CONFIG_ARGS
    string "Extra configure arguments for host ncurses"
    help
      Extra arguments that are passed verbatim to the configure when
      building host ncurses.

config NCURSES_HOST_DISABLE_DB
    bool "Disable terminfo DB on the host"
    default y
    help
      The terminfo database is not currently not installed on the host
      as a part of the toolchain built by crosstool-ng.  This means the
      library will not be able to use the terminals, unless that database
      comes preinstalled.

      Selecting this option allows one to embed some popular terminal
      definitions into the library itself.

      If not select, the path to the terminfo database on the host will
      likely need to be passed as an argument to configure.

config NCURSES_HOST_FALLBACKS
    string "List of fallback terminals for the host"
    default "linux,xterm,xterm-color,xterm-256color,vt100"
    help
      List of terminal descriptions that will be compiled into the curses
      library for the host.

config NCURSES_TARGET_CONFIG_ARGS
    string "Extra configure arguments for target ncurses"
    help
      Extra arguments that are passed verbatim to the configure when
      building target ncurses.

config NCURSES_TARGET_DISABLE_DB
    bool "Disable terminfo DB on the target"
    default n
    help
      The terminfo database is installed with the terminfo database for the
      target. If you want to configure ncurses with preselected terminals,
      select Y here.

config NCURSES_TARGET_FALLBACKS
    string "List of fallback terminals for the target"
    help
      List of terminal descriptions that will be compiled into the curses
      library for the target.
