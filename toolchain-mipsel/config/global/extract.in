comment "Extracting"

config FORCE_EXTRACT
    bool
    prompt "Force extractions"
    help
      Force extraction of already extracted tarballs.
      
      Useful if you suspect a previous extract did not complete (eg. broken
      tarball), or you added a new set of patches for this component.

config OVERRIDE_CONFIG_GUESS_SUB
    bool
    prompt "Override config.{guess,sub}"
    default y
    help
      Override tools' versions of config.guess and config.sub with the ones
      from crosstool-NG. This means that all instances of config.guess and
      config.sub in gcc, binutils, glibc, etc... will be replaced.

      Most of the time, the versions of those scripts found in packages are old
      versions, thus lacking some target definitions. This is the case for
      uClibc-based tuples in old versions of gcc and gdb, for example.

      Also, doing so will guarantee that all components have the same tuples
      definitions for your target, and not diverging ones.

      You can update the ones provided with crosstool-NG by first running:
        ct-ng updatetools
      in the directory where you want to run crosstool-NG prior to the build.

config ONLY_EXTRACT
    bool
    prompt "Stop after extracting tarballs"
    help
      Exit after unpacking and patching tarballs.
      
      Useful to look at the code before doing the build itself.

config PATCH_BUNDLED
    bool "Bundled only"
    help
      Only apply patches bundled with crosstool-NG.

config PATCH_LOCAL
    bool "Local only"
    select PATCH_USE_LOCAL
    depends on EXPERIMENTAL
    help
      Only apply your local patches. Many components require patching
      to build or work properly; please review the bundled patches and
      copy them into your local directory if needed.

config PATCH_BUNDLED_LOCAL
    bool "Bundled, then local"
    select PATCH_USE_LOCAL
    help
      Apply the patches bundled with crosstool-NG, then apply your local
      patches.

config PATCH_LOCAL_BUNDLED
    bool "Local, then bundled"
    select PATCH_USE_LOCAL
    depends on EXPERIMENTAL
    help
      Apply your local patches, then apply the patches bundled with
      crosstool-NG. Note that the bundled patches cannot be guaranteed
      to apply on top of your local patches.

config PATCH_NONE
    bool "None"
    depends on EXPERIMENTAL
    help
      Don't use any patch at all.
      
      Please be careful if you select this. Most components do require
      patches to properly build. It can happen, however, that support for
      your architecture is clean enough that you can build a toolchain
      with no patch. But most probably, this is *not* the case.
      
      Be safe, use (the bundeld) patches.
