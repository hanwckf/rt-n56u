      common format string attacks.

      a broken build, with an error message like:
        ../misc/syslog.c: In function '__vsyslog_chk':
        ../misc/syslog.c:123: sorry, unimplemented: inlining failed in
        call to 'syslog': function body not available

      the C library, thus ensuring that it will run on a large number
      of old kernels.
      
      The minimum kernel version supported will be dependent upon the
      target you build for. For example:
        alpha*-*-linux-gnu      Requires Linux 2.6.9 for NPTL
        sh[34]-*-linux-gnu      Requires Linux 2.6.11

      This is the default.
      
      If enabled, crosstool-ng will use the chosen version of kernel
      headers for the glibc minimum kernel version supported, which is
      what gets passed to "--enable-kernel=" when configuring glibc.
      
      Enabling this will ensure that no legacy compatibility code for
      older kernels is built into your C libraries, but it will
      be unable to run on kernel versions older than whichever kernel
      headers version you've built the toolchain for.
      
      If you know for sure that your toolchain will never need to build
      applications that will run under a kernel version older than your

      script.

      If you want to be able to statically link programs with your
      toolchain's C library, make sure this kernel version is lower than
      all kernels you wish to support to avoid "FATAL: kernel too old"
      errors.  The higher the version you specify, the less legacy code
      will be built into libc.
