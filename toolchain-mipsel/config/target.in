config ARCH_SUFFIX
    string
    prompt "Suffix to the arch-part"
    help
      Some architectures have multiple variants and being able to specify
      the variant instead of the arch is quite convenient. This is commonly
      seen for instance when "armv5tel-" is used as a prefix instead of the
      more generic "arm-", or with "alphaev6-" instead of "alpha-".
      
      Whatever you enter here will be appended to the architecture-part of the
      tuple, just before the first '-'. It will override any architecture-
      specific suffix that crosstool-NG may compute.
      
      If you are not sure about what this is, leave it blank.

config MULTILIB

    prompt "Build a multilib toolchain (READ HELP!!!)"
    help
      If you say 'y' here, then the toolchain will also contain the C library
      optimised for some variants of the selected architecture, besides the
      default settings.
      
      This means the build time of the C library will be in O(nb_variants).
      
      The list of variants is dependent on the architecture, and is hard-coded
      in gcc, so it is not possible to say what variants to support, only
      whether hard-coded variants should be supported or not.
      
      NOTE: The multilib feature in crosstool-NG is not well-tested.
            Use at your own risk, and report success and/or failure.

config DEMULTILIB
    bool "Attempt to combine libraries into a single directory"
    default y if !MULTILIB
    depends on !MULTILIB || EXPERIMENTAL
    help
      Normally, Crosstool-NG installs the libraries into the directories
      as the configure for these libraries determines appropriate. For
      example, for AArch64 glibc wants to install the libraries into
      /lib64 but the default dynamic linker path is /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1
      (which is installed as a symlink to ../lib64/ld-VER.so).

      However, not all consumers of the toolchain can handle the libraries
      residing in multiple directories. To appease them, crosstool-NG can
      attempt to combine the libraries back into a single /lib directory and
      create all other directories as symlinks to /lib. This requires all
      the library names to be unique within each sysroot.

      Note that GCC may also use separate sysroots for different multilibs.
      Hence it may make sense to enable this option even for multilib toolchains.
      However, separate roots are rare (any other architecture aside from
      SuperH using them?) and hence not well tested in crosstool-NG; therefore,
      this option is experimental when MULTILIB is enabled.

      If your architecture has an MMU and you want to use it,
      say 'Y' here.
      
      OTOH, if you don't want to use the MMU, or your arch
      lacks an MMU, say 'N' here.
      
      Note that some architectures (eg. ARM) has variants that
      lacks an MMU (eg. ARM Cortex-M3), while other variants
      have one (eg. ARM Cortex-A8).

      Emit hardware floating point opcodes.
      
      If you've got a processor with a FPU, then you want that.
      If your hardware has no FPU, you still can use HW floating point, but
      need to compile support for FPU emulation in your kernel. Needless to
      say that emulating the FPU is /slooowwwww/...
      
      One situation you'd want HW floating point without a FPU is if you get
      binary blobs from different vendors that are compiling this way and

      Emit hardware floating point opcodes but use the software
      floating point calling convention.

      Architectures such as ARM use different registers for passing
      floating point values depending on if they're in software mode
      or hardware mode.  softfp emits FPU instructions but uses the
      software FP calling convention allowing softfp code to
      interoperate with legacy software only code.

      If in doubt, use 'software' or 'hardware' mode instead.

      Do not emit any hardware floating point opcode.
