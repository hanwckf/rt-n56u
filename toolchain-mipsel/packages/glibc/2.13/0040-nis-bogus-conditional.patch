    Fix nss_nisplus build with mainline GCC (bug 20978).
    
    glibc build with current mainline GCC fails because
    nis/nss_nisplus/nisplus-alias.c contains code
    
      if (name != NULL)
        {
          *errnop = EINVAL;
          return NSS_STATUS_UNAVAIL;
        }
    
      char buf[strlen (name) + 9 + tablename_len];
    
    producing an error about strlen being called on a pointer that is
    always NULL (and a subsequent use of that pointer with a %s format in
    snprintf).
    
    As Andreas noted, the bogus conditional comes from a 1997 change:
    
    -  if (name == NULL || strlen(name) > 8)
    -    return NSS_STATUS_NOTFOUND;
    -  else
    +  if (name != NULL || strlen(name) <= 8)
    
    So the intention is clearly to return an error for NULL name.
    
    This patch duly inverts the sense of the conditional.  It fixes the
    build with GCC mainline, and passes usual glibc testsuite testing for
    x86_64.  However, I have not tried any actual substantive nisplus
    testing, do not have an environment for such testing, and do not know
    whether it is possible that strlen (name) or tablename_len might be
    large so that the VLA for buf is actually a security issue.  However,
    if it is a security issue, there are plenty of other similar instances
    in the nisplus code (that haven't been hidden by a bogus comparison
    with NULL) - and nis_table.c:__create_ib_request uses strdupa on the
    string passed to nis_list, so a local fix in the caller wouldn't
    suffice anyway (see bug 20987).  (Calls to strdupa and other such
    macros that use alloca must be considered equally questionable
    regarding stack overflow issues as direct calls to alloca and VLA
    declarations.)
    
            [BZ #20978]
            * nis/nss_nisplus/nisplus-alias.c (_nss_nisplus_getaliasbyname_r):
            Compare name == NULL, not name != NULL.
