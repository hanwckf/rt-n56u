Arch Maintainers List

Note: For the hard of thinking, this list is meant to remain in alphabetical
order. If you could add yourselves to it in alphabetical order that would be
so much easier [Ed].

P: Person
E: Person's email address
W: Web-page with status/info
S: Status, one of the following:

    Supported:      Someone is actually paid to look after this.
    Maintained:     Someone actually looks after it.
    Patches:        It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
                    much other than throw the odd patch in.  See below ...
    Unmaintained:   No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
                    role as you write your new code].
    Obsolete:       Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
                    it has been replaced by a better system and you
                    should be using that.
