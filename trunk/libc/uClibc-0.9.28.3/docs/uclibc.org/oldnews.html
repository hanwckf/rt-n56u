    <li> <b>20 April 2004, uClibc 0.9.26 based Debian uwoody</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of an x86 port of Debian woody compiled with uClibc 0.9.26.
    This was originally announced a couple of months ago, but has been updated
    a few times since to correct several small problems.  If you want an easy
    way to start building your own uClibc based applications, this is it.  This
    even supports building your own packages using 'apt-get', and using
    'apt-get' to install already compiled packages from uclibc.org.  You can
    find Erik's uwoody distribution <a
    href="http://www.uclibc.org/dists/">uwoody distribution here</a>.  Assembling
    this Debian/uClibc system required a <em>lot</em> of work, so if you
    think this is the coolest thing since the invention of water, feel free to
    <a href="http://uclibc.org/FAQ.html#support">let us know</a>.

    <li> <b>3 January 2004, uClibc 0.9.26 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is sorry to announce there was a pthread bug that
    slipped though our extensive testing and was only noticed a few hours after
    the previous release.  As a result, we are now releasing uClibc 0.9.26
    which fixes this bug, and is otherwise identical to the previous release.

    <p>

    This release remains binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.21-25, as long as
    you take care to avoid any configuraton changes that will break things.
    Please be aware we <b>will</b> break binary compatibilty in the upcoming
    0.9.27 release to implement a few necessary changes we have been
    postponing.  That will hopefully be the last ABI change before we freeze
    the ABI for the upcoming 1.0.x stable uClibc series.

    <li> <b>3 January 2004, uClibc 0.9.25 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.25.  This contains many bug fixes and cleanups, and is
    recommended for anyone using uClibc.  This release remains binary
    compatible with uClibc 0.9.21-24 (as long as you take care to avoid any
    configuraton changes that will break things).  We <b>were</b> planning to break
    binary compatibilty in this release, but decided to hold those changes so
    we could push out a bugfix release.

    <p>

    Please be aware we <b>will</b> break binary compatibilty in the upcoming
    0.9.26 release to implement a few changes we have been postponing.  That
    will hopefully be the last ABI change before we freeze the ABI for the

    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.24.  This contains various minor updates and fixes for a few
    silly configuration problems.  Arm users should notice a speed increase
    since some arm optimized string functions have been added.  And several
    bugs have been fixed.

    <p>

    This release continues to be binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.21 to 0.9.23
    -- as long as you pick compatible configuration options.  The next release
    will <b>not</b> be binary compatible.  We've been saving up a few needed
    changes that will be going into the next release, so while you will not
    need to recompile all your applications and libraries just yet, keep in
    mind we will have a flag day soon...

    were configuration problems in the previous release that made such it
    necessary to release .23 so quickly.  Updated uClibc development systems
    using uClibc 0.9.23 are being built and will be posted shortly.  And Erik
    has built Debian stable (woody) for x86 with uClibc and it runs great.

    <p>
    
    This release continues to be binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.21 and
    0.9.22 -- as long as you pick compatible configuration options.  Enabling
    or disabling things like soft-float, locale, wide char support, or changing
    cpu optimizations are all good examples of binary incompatible
    configuration options.  If have changed any of those sorts of options (or
    if you are not sure!) you will need to recompile all your applications and

    and is looking quite solid.  We have done quite a lot of testing with this
    release and things are looking good.  And Erik has built Debian stable
    (woody) for x86 with uClibc and it runs great.  Expect that to be released
    in the next few days.

    have been updated to uClibc 0.9.21 (plus all the CVS updates up to
    today).  Several problems have been fixed up,
    gcc has been updated to version 3.3.1, binutils was updated to 2.14.90.0.6, and
    <em>tada</em> everything finally works for cross compiling.  These were
    all cross compiled (which really makes things faster since the older
    mipsel releases used to take 2 days to build!)

    <p>
    These are ~100 MB ext2 filesystems that run natively on the specified
    architecture.  They contains all the development software you need to build
    your own uClibc applications, including bash, coreutils, findutils,
    diffutils, patch, sed, ed, flex, bison, file, gawk, tar, grep gdb, strace,
    make, gcc, g++,  autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh perl, 
    and more.   And of course, everything is dynamically linked against uClibc.  
    By using a uClibc only system, you can avoid all the painful
    cross-configuration problems that have made using uClibc somewhat painful
    in the past.  If you want to quickly get started with testing or using
    uClibc you should give these images a try.  You can loop mount and them
    you can chroot into them, you can boot into with using user-mode Linux, 
    and you can even 'dd' them to a spare partition and use resize2fs to make 
    them fill the drive.  Whatever works for you.

    <p>
    <li> <b>9 September 2003, uClibc 0.9.21 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.21.  This release has been brewing for several months now, and
    provides quite a lot of additional functionality and quite a few bug fixes
    as well.  Many people will be pleased that this release fixes the
    "dlopen()'ing libraries that depend on libraries" problem.

    <p>
    
    The biggest thing in this release (and I do mean that literally) is that
    uClibc now has full ANSI/ISO C99 locale support.  Well, except for
    wcsftime() and collating items in regex, which are not done yet.   Adding
    support for the default set of locales (169 UTF-8 locales and 144 locales
    using other codesets) will enlarge uClibc by around 300k.  Still, if you
    need locale support, that is still much better than the roughly 30MB the
    comparable set of locale date occupies with glibc.  And you can of course
    reduce the 300k by reducing the number of supported locales.

    <p>

    As usual, this release has many improvements, both large and small.  At
    this point, most applications that compile and work with glibc will also
    compile and run with uClibc.  Both Perl and Python pass all the tests in
    their test suites (both with and without locale support enabled).  We
    invite you to grab a copy of the latest <a
    href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/"> Linux Test Project test suite</a> and
    give uClibc some abuse.  We are not yet perfect, but we are getting pretty
    darn close.

    <p>
    
    This release is not binary compatible with earlier releases.  Depending on
    your configuration, you may actually still be binary compatible, but it
    would be a good idea to recompile your applications when moving to the
    uClibc 0.9.21 release.  We are sorry about that, but we have never promised
    to provide binary compatibility until we hit version 1.0.  And even then,
    if you change your uClibc configuration, you still still generally need to
    recompile...

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.20.  This is primarily a bug-fix release.  This release remains
    binary compatible with 0.9.18 and 0.9.19 (as long as you leave the
    new UCLIBC_HAS_TM_EXTENSIONS option disabled), so you don't have to recompile
    everything if you don't really feel like it.
    <p>

    This release has many small improvements.  At this point, most applications
    that compile and work with glibc will also compile and run with uClibc.
    Perl and Python even pass all the tests in their test suites.  
    <p>

    There is currently one notable exception.  Applications that use dlopen()
    to load libraries that themselves depend on other libraries, may have weak
    symbols within those depended-upon libraries resolved incorrectly.  This
    problem is currently being worked on.  Other than that, everything seems 
    to now be working as expected....

    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.18.  This is primarily a bug-fix release, as there were a few
    directory handling problem that could cause application using uClibc 0.9.17
    to either segfault or lose the first character when reading directry names.
    Unfortunately, once again, this release is _NOT_ binary compatible with
    earlier uClibc releases.  I _think this will be the last time (with the
    possible exception of some future changes to our locale support...)

    <li> <b>25 January 2003, uClibc 0.9.17 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.17.  The biggest piece of news with this release, thanks to
    Manuel Novoa's continuing hard work, is that we now have fully standards
    compliant locale support (optional of course).  The support works nicely,
    (though configuring the locales you wish to support is still manual -- a
    task for the next release).  Full locale data for over 300 locales adds
    approximately 250k.  The collation data for all supported locales is
    roughly 180k.  This may seem rather large to some -- but it is much smaller
    than the approximately 40 MB needed by Glibc to provide the same data.  And
    if you don't need it, you can either disable locale support entirely, or
    enable a smaller set of locales. 

    <p>

    This release also fixes <em>lots and lots</em> of bugs.  The arm
    architecture support (I am embarrassed to note) was totally broken in the
    last release, but is now working as expected.   A security problem (a
    buffer overflow in getlogin_r) was fixed.  And there were architecture
    updates across the board (x86, arm, powerpc, cris, h8300, sparc, and mips).
    And of course, this release includes the usual pile of bug fixes.  Many
    thanks for the large number of patches and fixes that were contributed!

    <p>

    Unfortunately, this release is not binary compatible with earlier uClibc
    releases.  As noted as item 3 <a href="downloads/Glibc_vs_uClibc_Differences.txt">here</a>, 
    uClibc does not (yet) attempt to
    ensure binary compatibility across releases.  We will eventually do that
    (once we reach the "1.0" release) but not yet.  A few bugs turned up that
    needed to be fixed, and the only good way to fix them was to change some
    fundamental data structure sizes.  As a result, this release is _NOT_
    binary compatible with earlier releases -- you will need to recompile your
    applications.  The x86, arm, powerpc, and mips architectures (i.e. the
    systems Erik has available in his office for testing) have been tested and
    are known to work following this change.  Other architectures <em>may</em> 
    need additional updates.  Sorry about that, but it had to be done.

    <li> <b>25 January 2003, dev system updates, arm image released</b>
    <br>

    A number of additional problems have been fixed and the arm build 
    is now, finally, compiling and working as expected.  As such, 
    I have updated the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_i386.bz2">
    i386 development system image</a>, the 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_powerpc.bz2">
    powerpc development system image</a>, and I am also releasing
    upon an unsuspecting world the brand new
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_arm.bz2">
    arm development system image</a>!  
    Have fun!
    <p>

    All three development system images were compiled and built using the stock
    <a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/buildroot/">buildroot</a> system.  These were also
    built using the (about to be announced in a couple on minutes) uClibc
    0.9.17 release, so if you want to begin compiling and testing stuff with
    uClibc, but you don't feel like spending the _hours_ it takes to download,
    configure, and build your own uClibc based development system -- then you
    may want to download these and give them a try.  They each contain a 100 MB
    ext2 filesystem with everything you need to begin compiling your own
    applications.  I have (at least minimally) tested each of them and verified
    that the included gcc and g++ compilers produce working uClibc linked
    executables.

    <p>
    Oh, and I have also have updated the uClibc/gcc toolchain builders, so
    if you just want a simple uClibc/gcc toolchain, 
    <a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/toolchain/">one of these should work for you.</a>
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>10 January 2003, dev system updates, powerpc image released</b>
    <br>

    A few problems showed up in yesterday's development system release
    (adduser was broken, gdb didn't work, libstdc++ shared libs were missing,
    etc).  So I've updated the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_i386.bz2">
    i386 development system image</a> to fix these problems.
    Also, the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_powerpc.bz2">
    powerpc development system image</a> has finally finished compiling
    and is now released upon an unsuspecting world.  Have fun!

    <p>
    <li> <b>9 January 2003, uClibc development system released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has been working hard on <a
    href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/buildroot/">buildroot</a> recently, and is pleased to
    offer a full stand-alone uClibc-only development system.  This is an ext2
    filesystem for i386 containing all the development software you need to
    build your own uClibc applications.  With bash, awk, make, gcc, g++,
    autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh, gdb, strace, valgrind,
    busybox, GNU coreutils, and more, this should have pretty much everything
    you need to get started building your own applications linked against
    uClibc.  By using a uClibc only system, you can avoid all the painful
    cross-configuration problems that have made using uClibc somewhat painful
    in the past.  A powerpc and an arm version are in progress.  Expect them
    to be released shortly....

    <p>

    The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_i386.bz2">
    uClibc development system is an 18MB bzip2 compressed ext2 filesystem</a>,
    so be prepared to wait if you are on a slow link.  If you wish to have more
    space, you can loop mount it and 'cp -a' the contents to their own
    partition, or do what I did... <EM>WARNING, the following can be very
    dangerous.  Please be sure you know what you are doing before trying this.
    I am not responsible if you lose all your important data.</EM>I had a spare
    hard drive (in my case /dev/hdg but you'll want to adapt this to your own 
    needs), so I partitioned it with a single ext2 partition filling the drive 
    (in my case /dev/hdg1).  Then I ran:<PRE>
    bzcat root_fs_i386.bz2 | dd of=/dev/hdg1
    e2fsck -f /dev/hdg1
    resize2fs -p /dev/hdg1</PRE>

    which overwrote everything on /dev/hdg with the new uClibc devel system,
    and then expanded the filesystem with the uClibc devel system till it
    filled the whole drive.

    <li> <b>8 November 2002, uClibc 0.9.16 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.16.  This release adds full support (including a native shared
    library loader) for the CRIS architecture, contributed by Tobias Anderberg.
    Stefan Allius contributed a number of patches to fix the initialization
    order for shared library global constructors and destructors as well as a
    large number of SuperH fixes and cleanups.  uClibc now compiles with
    newer versions of gcc (i.e. RedHat 8.0).  Thanks to Christian Michon,
    uClibc no longer requires perl to compile.  Steven J. Hill fixed dlopen for
    mips.  Several problems with pty and tty handling were fixed.  Manuel Novoa
    added new support for an /etc/TZ file to globally set the system timezone,
    and fixed up a number of remaining wide char issues.  Manuel is still hard
    at work on bringing full locale support (optional of course) to uClibc.
    And of course, this release includes the usual pile of bug fixes.  Many thanks
    for the large number of patches and fixes that were contributed!
    <p>

    Erik and Manuel have been working on a 
    <a href="downloads/Glibc_vs_uClibc_Differences.txt">
    document describing some of the differences between uClibc and glibc.</a>
    It's not yet 100% complete, and it hasn't been nicely formatted yet.  But
    it contains a lot of helpful information and is worth a look.
    <p>

    And finally, the the old uClibc configuration system has been completely
    removed (and there was much rejoicing).  It was replaced with an entirely
    new system based on <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/lc/">LinuxKernelConf</a>, 
    which has since been included into Linux 2.5.45, so it looks like Erik made 
    the right choice.  Of course, those who have existing build systems using uClibc 
    will need to make a few changes...  We think the change is worth it.

    <p>
    <li> <b>16 September 2002, gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95 toolchains released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released updated gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95
    uClibc toolchains.  These toolchains build real gcc cross compilers (i.e.
    not just a wrapper) and create executables linked vs uClibc.   The new
    gcc-3.2 provides uClibc support with the latest and greatest compiler
    available from the gcc team.  The gcc-2.95 toolchain has been updated to
    the latest version of uClibc and now provides full C++ support, using the
    <a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a> standard C++ library.
    <p>

    This toolchain should make it easy for anyone to build uClibc based 
    applications.  
    <a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/toolchain/"> Source code can be downloaded here</a>. 
    Be aware that much of the needed source code will actually be downloaded on
    when you compile the toolchains.  To build a toolchain, simply
    grab the source, edit the Makefile to select where you would like
    the toolchain installed, run 'make', and then go watch TV, eat
    dinner, or visit with your friends while it compiles.  It takes
    about 15 minutes for Erik to compile the gcc-3.2 toolchain (w/C++ support)
    on his Athlon XP 1600 (not counting the time it takes to download
    source code).

    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability 
    of uClibc 0.9.15.  This release fixes a number of problems that turned 
    up since the last release.   The good news is that uClibc now 
    passes all tests in the perl 5.8 and Python 2.2.1 test suites, both with
    and without pthreads.  So without any further ado....

    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is slightly less pleased then usual to announce the
    immediate availability of uClibc 0.9.14.  This is, unfortunately, a bugfix
    release intended to fix the couple of dumb things that slipped into the
    previous release.  Version 0.9.13 of uClibc would fail to compile when
    enabling both RPC and Pthreads.  There was also a problem with RPC thread
    local storage (but noone noticed since it didn't compile ;-).  Also, the
    thread locking in exit(), onexit() and atexit() was broken, and wasn't
    actually locking anything.   This release also fixes uClibc's gcc wrapper
    to use crtbeginS.o and crtendS.o when compiling PIC code, fixing a subtle
    bug (that was much less subtle on powerpc).  Finally, this release includes a
    few minor compile warning cleanups.

    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released an updated native
    uClibc/gcc-3.1.1 toolchain.   This toolchain builds a real gcc cross
    compiler (i.e. not just a wrapper) and creates executables linked vs
    uClibc.  This toolchain has been (briefly) tested as working on x86, arm,
    mips, and arm7tdmi (uClinux).  This toolchain provides a number of
    improvements over previous releases.   In particular, Steven J. Hill found
    and fixes a number of "glibc-isms" in the libstdc++ math support which
    caused a number of math functions to be mapped to the non-standard named
    under GNU libc.   This release also includes greatly improved uClinux
    "elf2flt" support, and it now produces working flat binaries for my
    uClinux/arm7tdmi system.  The native uClibc/gcc-2.95 toolchain will be
    updated in a few days, and will include STLport which will allow that
    toolchain to also provide full C++ support.

    uClibc 0.9.13.  After several days of testing, this release is looking very
    solid.   This release fixes three security vulnerabilites in previous
    releases.  There was an off-by-one buffer overflow in the group handling
    code, and integer overflows in calloc() and xdr_array().  
    <p>

    This release adds native shared library support for the Hitachi
    SuperH architecture, thanks to Stefan Allius and Edie C. Dost.  A 
    new mmap based malloc was implemented by Miles Bader.  This is much 
    smarter than the old "malloc-simple" and is now the default for 
    mmu-less systems, where it should greatly help reduce memory
    fragmentation and wastage.  In addition to these larger items, there
    has been a <em>lot</em> of work done to make uClibc a cleaner, more
    capable, library.  Most applications now compile and run without 
    any trouble.

    fully working mips shared library support, shared library support fixes
    for on powerpc, and many other improvements.  One very exciting new feature
    is nearly complete locale support, thanks to a lot of hard work by Manuel
    Novoa III.  uClibc's locale support is <em>much</em> smaller than glibc's,
    though it is also slightly less flexible.  This release was delayed by a
    month due to the arrival of a new baby at Erik's house.  For those that

    Large file support has been improved, and a thread locking bug was
    fixed that could cause s*printf calls to deadlock when threading was
    enabled.  Several bugs were also fixed with the powerpc, h8300, m68k,

    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of uClibc 0.9.10. This release adds pthreads support
    (including pthreads support for mmu-less systems!).  Additionally,
    thanks to Manuel Novoa III, we now have a completely new stdio
    library, which is small, standards compliant, supports pthreads,
    wide/narrow streams, large files, and can even operate in a
    low-memory unbuffered mode.  Many, many bugs have been fixed and a
    number of additional applications now compile and run perfectly.
    Even with all these changes, uClibc continues to be very small.
    On x86, a default build of the uClibc C library is still just 168k.

    <p>

    To make things more interesting, the release also adds support for
    C++ constructors and destructors.  To make it easy to use uClibc
    when developing C++ applications, this release also provides a 
    wrapper for the GNU C++ compiler.  Of course, for more complex C++
    applications, such as those using iostreams, a standard C++ library
    (libstdc++) is required.  A native GNU toolchain (binutils/gcc) that
    provides libstdc++ linked with uClibc 0.9.10 will be released in the
    next couple of days, so stay tuned.

    One final bit on news -- as some of you may have noticed, uclibc.org 
    has been a bit overloaded and somewhat slow recently.  The server should 
    be getting colocated tomorrow, which will eliminate the speed problem.  
    During the move, there may be some temporary disruption of service...
    <p>
    Have Fun!

    <li> <b>22 December 2001, uClibc 0.9.8 Released!</b>
    <br>

    After many months of initial development, we are pleased to announce the
    release of uClibc 0.9.8.  This release should be quite solid, and is very
    usable.  This also, hopefully, marks a transition from a slow incubation
    phase to a more methodical release cycle.  From now one, there should be
    approximately one release per month.
    <p>
    The source code for this release is available
	<a href="downloads/">here</a>.


    <p>
    <li> <b>26 November 2001, powerpc shared libraries fully working</b>
    <br>
    Dave Schleef finished off the the work needed for shared library support on
    powerpc.  There had been a few problems remaining, and those are now squashed.
    So shared libs on powerpc should be working fully now.

    <p>
    <li> <b>14 November 2001, m68 compiles again, Large file support working</b>
    <br>
	About a month ago I synced the header files with glibc 2.2.4 for better
	C++ support and better standards compliance.  I forgot to sync up m68k,
	sparc, powerpc, and mipsel.  Dave Schleef fixed powerpc while he was fixing
	up the shared lib loader.  I just fixed up m68k, sparc, and mipsel so they
	should all compile again.
	<p>
	I also finished up fixing large file support (just enable DOLFS in your
	Config file to enable it) and it is working just great, and greatly increases
	the number of glibc applications that will work "out-of-the-tarball" without
	needing any changes.


    <li> <b>12 November 2001, powerpc shared lib support</b>
    <br>
	Thanks to David Schleef, uClibc now has full shared library support 
	on powerpc.  This brings full shared library support to x86, ARM, and 
	now powerpc.  Thanks Dave!


    <p>
    <li> <b>7 November 2001, uClibc application list</b>
    <br>
	uClibc now has a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> 
	that are known to work.  If you have any applications to add to the
	list, submissions are welcome!


    <p>
    <li> <b>18 October 2001, buildroot uClibc example system</b>
    <br>

	Those wanting an easy way to test out uClibc and give it
	a test drive can download and compile 
	<a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/buildroot/">buildroot</a>. 
	This is a nifty buildsystem that will automagically download and build
	a <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-Mode Linux</a>
	kernel, and will then download source for and compile up a fully
	working uClibc based root filesystem.  This should make it easy for
	people to create their own projects.  I hope that this build system
	will allow people to more easily use and build uClibc based systems.
	As an example of how nicely this works, the 
	<a href="http://tuxscreen.net/">Tuxscreen Project</a> is using a
	<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tuxscreen/buildroot-tux/">slightly adjusted variant of the buildroot system</a> to cross 
	compile the blob bootloader, linux kernel, and a uClibc based jffs2
	root filesystem (busybox, tinylogin, udhcp, lrzsz, pcmcia-cs and 
	microwindows) for ARM.  Pretty cool.



    <p>
    <li> <b>11 October 2001, v850 architecture support</b>
    <br>

	Miles Bader has contributed support for the v850 architecture.


    <p>
    <li> <b>25 Spetember 2001, header files updated</b>
    <br>

	uClibc's header files are now in sync with glibc 2.2.4,
    allowing better standards compliance, better portibility, and 
    better C++ support.
    
    <p>
    <li> <b>4 July 2001, ARM shared library support</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has full shared library support on ARM.


    <p>
    <li> <b>9 May 2001, libm added</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has a very complete math library.


    <p>
    <p> <li> <b>9 May 2001, ld.so added</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has a native ld.so.  It currently is only ported to work on x86,
	but porting to other architectures should not be too difficult.


    <p> <li> <b>15 March 2001, powerpc port added</b>
    <br>

	David Schleef contributed a powerpc port, which is now in CVS.

    <p> <li> <b>19 February 2001, SH port added</b>
    <br>

	Jean-Yves Avenard contributed an SH port.  See his email 
	with the initial patch <a href="/lists/uclibc/2001-February/000409.html">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>16 January 2001, uClibc as a shared library</b>
    <br>

	 As if January 16, uClibc can now be used (at least on x86) as a shared
	library.  See the <a href="/lists/uclibc/2001-January/000126.html">email</a>
	announcing this achievement.

    <p> <li> <b>11 January 2001, gcc wrapper added</b>
    <br>

	Manuel Novoa III has created a wrapper for gcc that makes compiling apps vs uClibc
	as simple as just setting "CC" to gcc-uClibc-&lt arch&gt.  This even works when cross
	compiling!  Very cool.

    <p> <li> <b>3 January 2001, uClibc now has a web page</b>
    <br>

	 A lot of work has been going on under the hood with uClibc,
	 so I decided to put together this webpage to let the world know
	 that it exists and is getting to be usable. 

</ul>
