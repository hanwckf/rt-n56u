Release 0.7:
- Destructors for thread-specific data now conform to the POSIX semantics
  (call destructors again if non-NULL TSD remains after a round of
   destruction).
- Implemented thread-specific data as a sparse array, allows more TSD keys
  and smaller thread descriptors (Ulrich Drepper).
- Added "error checking" mutexes.
- Protect against multiple sigwait() on the same signals.
- Simplified implementation of semaphores when compare_and_swap is 
  not available.
- Fixed bug in fork() where stdin was closed if fork() was called before
  the first pthread_create().
- Fixed bug in the gethostby*_r functions (bad result if null bytes
  in addresses).
- Typos in manual pages corrected.
- First cut at a PowerPC port (not working yet, runs into problems
  with gcc and with the C library).

Release 0.6:
- Validation of thread identifiers: no more crashes when operating on
  a thread that has exited (based on Pavel Krauz's ideas).
- Added fallback implementation of semaphores for the 386 and the
  Sparc. 
- Fixed a bug in signal handling causing false restarts of suspended
  threads.
- Fixed a bug in realtime scheduling causing all threads to have
  default scheduling on Ix86 with libc5.
- With realtime scheduling, unlocking a mutex now restarts the
  highest priority thread waiting on the mutex, not the
  first-suspended thread (Richard Neitzel).
- Timing a process now returns cumulative times for all threads, not
  just times for the initial thread (suggested by Wolfram Gloger).
- Cleaned up name space (internal defs prefixed by __, weak aliases
  for non-portable extensions).
- MIPS port (contributed by Ralf Baechle).

Release 0.5:
- Signal-safe semaphores a la POSIX 1003.1b added.
- Locking bug in pthread_mutex_trylock over recursive mutexes fixed.
- Race conditions in thread cancellation fixed.
- Sparc port (contributed by Miguel de Icaza).
- Support for getpwnam_r and getpwuid_r.
- Added pthread_kill_other_threads_np to be used in conjunction with
  exec*().

Release 0.4:
- Manual pages for all functions.
- Synchronization bug causing accumulation of zombie processes fixed.
- Race condition in pthread_cond_timedwait fixed.
- Recursive mutexes are back by popular demand.
- Partial support for realtime scheduling (initiated by Richard Neitzel).
- pthread.h cleaned up a lot: now C++ compatible, added missing "const" 
  qualifiers, added short documentation, put to GNU libc standards
  for name space pollution (Ulrich Drepper).
- Motorola 68k port (contributed by Andreas Schwab).
- Interaction with fork(2) cleaned up a lot.

Release 0.3:
- Thread creation and reclaimation now performed by a centralized
  "thread manager" thread.
- Removed recursive mutexes to make regular mutexes more efficient.
- Now available as a shared library (contributed by Richard Henderson).
- Alpha port (contributed by Richard Henderson).
- Fixed many small discrepancies with Posix 1003.1c.
- Put under the LGPL instead of the GPL.

Release 0.2:
- Reentrant libc functions (adapted from libc 5.3.9 by Peeter Joot)
- pthread_cond_wait did not reacquire the mutex correctly on return
- More efficient pthread_cond_broadcast

Release 0.1:
- First public release
