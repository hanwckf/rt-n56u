<h2><a name="naming">Why is it called uClibc?</a></h2>
<p>

    The letter 'u' is short for µ (the greek letter "mu").  µ is commonly used
    as the abbreviation for the word "micro".  The capital "C" is short for
    "controller".  So the name uClibc is sortof an abbreviation for "the
    microcontroller C library".  For simplicity, uClibc is pronounced
    "yew-see-lib-see".
    <p>
    The name is partly historical, since uClibc was originally
    created to support <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">µClinux</a>, a port of
    Linux for MMU-less microcontrollers such as the Dragonball, Coldfire, and
    ARM7TDMI.  These days, uClibc also works just fine on normal Linux systems
    (such as i386, ARM, and PowerPC), but we couldn't think of a better name.

<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="platforms">What platforms does uClibc run on?</a></h2>
<p>


    Currently uClibc runs on alpha, ARM, cris, i386, i960, h8300,
    m68k, mips/mipsel, PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="why">Why are you doing this?  What's wrong with glibc?</a></h2>
<p>

    Initially, the project began since the GNU C library lacked support for
    MMU-less systems, and because glibc is very large.  The GNU C library is
    designed with a very different set of goals then uClibc.  The GNU C library
    is a great piece of software, make no mistake.  It is compliant with just
    about every standard ever created, and runs on just about every operating
    system and architecture -- no small task!  But there is a price to be paid
    for that.  It is quite a large library, and keeps getting larger with each
    release.  It does not even pretend to target embedded systems.  To quote
    from Ulrich Drepper, the maintainer of GNU libc: "...glibc is not the right
    thing for [an embedded OS]. It is designed as a native library (as opposed
    to embedded).  Many functions (e.g., printf) contain functionality which is
    not wanted in embedded systems." 24 May 1999

<p>
<h2><a name="doesnt_suck">So uClibc is smaller then glibc?  Doesn't that mean it completely sucks?
How could it be smaller and not suck?</a></h2>
<p>
<p>

    uClibc and glibc have different goals.  glibc strives for features
    and performance, and is targeted for desktops and servers with
    (these days) lots of resources.  It also strives for ABI stability.

    <p>

    On the other hand, the goal of uClibc is to provide as much functionality
    as possible in a small amount of space, and it is intended primarily for
    embedded use.  It is also highly configurable in supported features, at the
    cost of ABI differences for different configurations.  uClibc has been
    designed from the ground up to be a C library for embedded Linux.  We don't
    need to worry about things like MS-DOS support, or BeOS, or AmigaOs any
    other system.  This lets us cut out a lot of complexity and very carefully
    optimize for Linux.

    <p>

    In other cases, uClibc leaves certain features (such as full C99 Math
    library support, wordexp, IPV6, and RPC support) disabled by default.
    Those features can be enabled for people that need them, but are otherwise
    disabled to save space.

    <p>

    Some of the space savings in uClibc is obtained at the cost of performance,
    and some is due to sacrificing features.  Much of it comes from aggressive
    refactoring of code to eliminate redundancy.  In regards to locale data,
    elimination of redundant data storage resulted in substantial space
    savings.  The result is a libc that currently includes the features needed
    by nearly all applications and yet is considerably smaller than glibc.  To
    compare "apples to apples", if you take uClibc and compile in locale data
    for about 170 UTF-8 locales, then uClibc will take up about 570k.  If you
    take glibc and add in locale data for the same 170 UTF-8 locales, you will
    need over 30MB!!!

    <p>

    The end result is a C library that will compile just about everything you
    throw at it, that looks like glibc to application programs when you
    compile, and is many times smaller.

<p>
<h2><a name="why_should_i">Why should I use uClibc?</a></h2>
<p>

    I don't know if you should use uClibc or not.  It depends on your needs.
    If you are building an embedded Linux system and you are tight on space, then
    using uClibc instead if glibc may be a very good idea.

    <p>

    If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that
    glibc is eating up too much space, you should consider using
    uClibc.  If you are building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes
    of storage, then using glibc may make more sense.  Unless, for
    example, that 12 Terabytes will be Network Attached Storage and
    you plan to burn Linux into the system's firmware...



<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="licensing">If I use uClibc, do I have to release all my source code to the world for
	free?  I want to create a closed source commercial application and I want
	to protect my intellectual property.</a></h2>
<p>

    No, you do not need to give away your application source code just because
    you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.  uClibc is licensed under the <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">Lesser GPL</a> licence, just
    like the GNU C library (glibc).  Please read this licence, or have a lawyer
    read this licence if you have any questions.  Here is my brief summary...
    Using shared libraries makes complying with the license easy.  You can
    distribute a closed source application which is linked with an unmodified
    uClibc shared library.  In this case, you do not need to give away any
    source code for your application.  Please consider sharing some of the
    money you make with us!  :-)
    <p>

    If you make any changes to uClibc, and distribute uClibc or distribute any
    applications using your modified version, you must also distribute the
    source code for uClibc containing all of your changes.
    <p>

    If you distribute an application which has uClibc statically linked, you
    must also make your application available as an object file which can later
    be re-linked against updated versions of uClibc.  This will (in theory)
    allow your customers to apply uClibc bug fixes to your application.  You do
    not need to make the application object file available to everyone, just to
    those you gave the fully linked application.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="development">Can I use it on my x86 development system?</a></h2>
<p>

    Sure!  In fact, this can be very nice during development.  By
    installing uClibc on your development system, you can be sure that
    the code you are working on will actually run when you deploy it on
    your target system.



<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="shared"> Does uClibc support shared libraries?</a></h2>
<p>

    Yes.  uClibc has native shared library support on i386, ARM, mips,
    SH, CRIS, and PowerPC processors.  Other architectures can use shared
    libraries but will need to use the GNU libc shared library loader.
    <p>
    Shared Libraries are not currently supported by uClibc on MMU-less systems.
    <a href="http://www.snapgear.com/">SnapGear</a> has implemented
    shared library support for MMU-less systems, however, so if you need MMU-less
    shared library support they may be able to help.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="compiling">How do I compile programs with uClibc?</a></h2>
<p>

    You will need to have your own uClibc toolchain.  A toolchain consists
    of <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/">GNU binutils</a>,
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">the gcc compiler</a>, and uClibc, all
    built to produce binaries for your target system linked with uClibc.
    You can build your own native uClibc toolchain using the
    <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">uClibc buildroot system</a>.

    <p>
    To build your own uClibc toolchain, follow the following simple
    steps:
    <ul>
	<li> Point your web browser <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">here</a>,
	<li> Download of copy of buildroot
	<li> Unpack the tarball on your Linux system somewhere
	<li> Edit the Makefile as needed if you wish to change anything.
	<li> run 'unset CC'.   Then run 'unset CXX'.  Some Linux systems
	    (i.e. Gentoo) set variables such as 'CC' in the system environment
	    which really messes things up when cross compiling.
	<li> run 'make menuconfig'
	<li> Select the things you want to build.  If you <em>only</em> want a
	    toolchain, leave everything except the toolchain disabled.
	<li> save your buildroot configuration.
	<li> run 'make'
	<li> go eat a nice wholesome sandwich, drink a pop, call a friend,
	    play a video game, and generally find something to do.  While you
	    are waiting, buildroot will download all the needed source code and
	    then compile things up for you.
	<li> You should now have a shiny new toolchain, and maybe even a shiny
	    new uClibc based root filesystem or development system, depending on
	    the options you selected.
    </ul>

<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="toolchain">Do I really need to build a uClibc toolchain?</h2>
<p>

    Yes, you really do need to build a toolchain to produce uClibc binaries.
    We used to provide a toolchain wrapper, but that has been removed due to
    numerous problems.  The uClibc developers have gone to a lot of trouble
    to produce the
    <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">uClibc buildroot system</a>,
    which makes it easy to build your own uClibc toolchain and/or an initial
    uClibc based system.

    <p>
    Feel free to take the gcc and binutils patches we provide and use them in
    your own toolchain build system.  If you choose to use your own toolchain
    build system, you will need to use these patches since the upstream GNU
    binutils and gcc releases do not currently have full support for building a
    uClibc toolchain.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="wrapper">What happened to the old toolchain wrapper?</h2>
<p>

    It is possible in some limited cases to re-use an existing glibc toolchain
    and subvert it into building uClibc binaries by using gcc commands such as
    "-nostdlib" and "-nostdinc".   In fact, this used to be the recommended
    method for compiling programs with uClibc, and we made this easy to do by
    providing a uClibc toolchain wrapper, which attempted to automagically subvert
    an existing glibc toolchain.

    <p>

    This toolchain wrapper was removed from uClibc 0.9.22, and it will not be
    coming back.  This is because it proved impossible to completely subvert an
    existing toolchain in many cases, and therefore proved to be a real
    maintainence burder.  As uClibc became more capable, the many problems with
    re-using an existing glibc toolchain led us to conclude that the only safe
    and sane way to build uClibc binaries was to use a uClibc toolchain.

    <p>

    Some discussion on the reasoning behind this decision can be found here:
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/lists/uclibc/2003-October/007315.html">
    http://www.uclibc.org/lists/uclibc/2003-October/007315.html</a>
    in the uClibc mailing list archives.

<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="dev_systems">Is a pre-compiled uClibc development system available?</a></h2>
<p>

    If you want to be <em>really</em> lazy and start using uClibc right away
    without needing to compile your own toolchain or anything, you can grab a
    pre-compiled uClibc development system.  These are currently available for

    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_arm.ext2.bz2">arm</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_armeb.ext2.bz2">armeb</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_i386.ext2.bz2">i386</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_mips.ext2.bz2">mips</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_mipsel.ext2.bz2">mipsel</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_powerpc.ext2.bz2">powerpc</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_sh4.ext2.bz2">sh4</a>.

    <p>

    These are bzip2 compressed ext2 filesystems containing all the development
    software you need to build your own uClibc applications, including: bash, awk,
    make, gcc, g++, autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh, gdb,
    strace, busybox, GNU coreutils, GNU tar, GNU grep, etc.

    <p>

    Each of these uClibc development systems was created using
    <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">buildroot</a>, specifically,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/buildroot.tar.bz2">buildroot.tar.bz2</a>
    along with <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/buildroot-sources">these sources</a>.

    <p>

    These development systems should provide pretty much everything you need to get
    started building your own applications with uClibc.  Once you download one of
    these systems, you can then boot into it, loop mount it, dd it to a spare drive
    and use a tool such as resize2fs to make it fill a partition...  Whatever works
    best for you.

    <p>
    The quickest way to get started using a root_fs image (using the i386
    platform as an example) is:
    <ul>
	<li>Download root_fs_i386.bz2 from uclibc.org</li>
	<li>bunzip2 root_fs_i386.bz2</li>
	<li>mkdir root_fs</li>
	<li>su root</li>
	<li>mount -o loop root_fs_i386 root_fs</li>
	<li>chroot root_fs /bin/su -</li>
    </ul>
    Type "exit" to end the chroot session and return to the host system.
    <p>

<p>
<h2><a name="bugs">I think I found a bug in uClibc!  What should I do?</h2>
<p>

    If you find a problem with uClibc, please submit a detailed bug report to
    the uClibc mailing list at <a href="mailto:uclibc@mail.uclibc.org">
    uclibc@mail.uclibc.org</a>.  Please do not send private email to Erik
    (the maintainer of uClibc) asking for private help unless you are planning
    on paying for consulting services.  When we answer questions on the uClibc
    mailing list, it helps everyone, while private answers help only you...

    A well-written bug report should include an example that demonstrates the
    problem behaviors and enables anyone else to duplicate the bug on their own
    machine.  For larger applications where it may prove difficult to provide
    an example application, we recommend that you use a tool such as gdb,
    strace, ltrace, and or valgrind to create a logfile showing the problem
    behavior.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="miscompile">My package builds fine but link fails with errors like 
	"undefined reference to __fputc_unlocked", who do I blame?!</h2>
<p>

    This error crops up when a build system mixes system headers (say glibc) 
    with the target headers (say uClibc).  Make sure your build system is not 
    including extraneous include options (-I) and double check that it is using 
    the correct compiler.  Many build systems incorrectly force things like 
    -I/usr/include or -I/usr/local/include or -I${prefix}/include (which usually 
    just expands to -I/usr/include).


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="job_control">Why do I keep getting "sh: can't access tty; job control
	turned off" errors?  Why doesn't Control-C work within my shell?</a></h2>
<p>

    This isn't really a uClibc question, but I'll answer it here anyways.  Job
    control will be turned off since your shell can not obtain a controlling
    terminal.  This typically happens when you run your shell on /dev/console.
    The kernel will not provide a controlling terminal on the /dev/console
    device.  Your should run your shell on a normal tty such as tty1 or ttyS0
    and everything will work perfectly.  If you <em>REALLY</em> want your shell
    to run on /dev/console, then you can hack your kernel (if you are into that
    sortof thing) by changing drivers/char/tty_io.c to change the lines where
    it sets "noctty = 1;" to instead set it to "0".  I recommend you instead
    run your shell on a real console...


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="autoconf">How do I make autoconf and automake behave?</a></h2>
<p>

    When you are cross-compiling, autoconf and automake are known to behave
    badly.  This is because a large number of configure scripts (such as the
    one from openssh) try to actually execute applications that were cross
    compiled for your target system.  This is bad, since of course these won't
    run, and this will also prevent your programs from compiling.  You need to
    complain to the authors of these programs and ask them to fix their broken
    configure scripts.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="ldd">When I run 'ldd' to get a list of the library dependencies
	for a uClibc binary, ldd segfaults!  What should I do?</a></h2>
<p>

    Use the ldd that is built by uClibc, not your system's one.  You can build
    uClibc'd ldd for your host system by going into the uClibc/utils/ directory
    in the uClibc source and running 'make ldd.host'.
    <p>

    When your system's ldd looks for library dependencies, it actually _runs_
    that program.  This works fine -- usually.  It generally will not work at
    all when you have been cross compiling (which is why ldd segfaults).  The
    ldd program created by uClibc is cross platform and doesn't mind at all if
    it cannot execute the target program.  If you use the uClibc version of
    'ldd', it will do the right thing and produce correct results, even when it
    is used on cross compiled binaries.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="timezones">Why does localtime() return times in UTC even when I have my timezone set?</a></h2>
<p>


    The uClibc time functions get timezone information from the TZ environment
    variable, as described in the Single Unix Specification Version 3.  See
     <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html">
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html</a>
    for details on valid settings of TZ.  For some additional examples, read
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/lists/uclibc/2002-August/006261.html">
    http://www.uclibc.org/lists/uclibc/2002-August/004010.html</a> in the uClibc
    mailing list archive.
    You can store the value of TZ in the file '/etc/TZ' and uClibc will then
    automagically use the specified setting.


<hr />
<p>
<h2><a name="history">What is the history of uClibc?  Where did it come from?</a></h2>
<p>


    uClibc started off as a fork on the <a
    href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~mayday/">Linux-8086 C library</a>, which is
    part of the <a href="http://www.elks.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">elks project</a>.
    The Linux-8086 C library was, apparently, largely written from scratch but
    also borrowed code from libc4, glibc, some Atari library code, with bits
    and pieces from about 20 other places.

    <p>

    I had for some time been despairing over the state of C libraries in Linux.
    GNU libc, the standard, is very poorly suited to embedded systems and has
    been getting bigger with every release.  I spent quite a bit of time
    looking over the available Open Source C libraries that I knew of, and none
    of them really impressed me.  I felt there was a real vacancy in the
    embedded Linux ecology.  The closest library to what I imagined an embedded
    C library should be was uClibc.  But it had a lot of problems too -- not
    the least of which was that, traditionally, uClibc required a complete
    source tree fork in order to support each and every new platform.  This
    resulted in a big mess of twisty versions, all different.  I decided to fix
    it and the result is what you see here.

    <p>

    To start with, (with some initial help from <a
    href="http://www.uclinux.org/developers/">D. Jeff Dionne</a>), I ported
    uClibc to run on i386.  I then grafted in the header files from glibc and
    cleaned up the resulting breakage.  This (plus some additional work) has
    made it much less dependant on kernel headers, a large departure from its
    traditional tightly-coupled-to-the-kernel origins.  I have written and/or
    rewritten a number of things that were missing or broken, and sometimes
    grafted in bits of code from the current glibc and libc5.  I have also
    added a proper configuration system which allows you to easily select your
    target architecture and enable and disable various features.  Many people
    have helped by testing, contributing ports to new architectures, and adding
    support for missing features.

    <p>

    In particular, around the end of 2000, Manuel Novoa III got involved with
    uClibc.  One of his first contributions was the original gcc wrapper (which
    has since been removed).  Since then, he has written virtually all of the
    current uClibc stdio, time, string, ctype, locale, and wchar-related code,
    as well as much of stdlib and various other bits throught the library.

    <p>

    These days, uClibc is being developed and enhanced by Erik Andersen
    and Manuel Novoa III of
    <a href="http://codepoet-consulting.com/">CodePoet Consulting</a>
    along with the rest of the embedded Linux community.

    When we answer questions on the uClibc mailing list, it helps everyone
    since people with similar problems in the future will be able to get help
    by searching the mailing list archives.  Private help is reserved as a paid
    service.  If you need to use private communication, or if you are serious
    about getting timely assistance with uClibc, you should seriously consider
    paying for consulting time.

<h2><a name="contracts">I need you to add &lt;favorite feature&gt;!  Are the uClibc developers willing to
	be paid in order to fix bugs or add in &lt;favorite feature&gt;?  Are you willing to provide
	support contracts?</a></h2>
<p>

    Sure!  Now you have our attention!  What you should do is contact <a
	href="mailto:andersen@codepoet.org">Erik Andersen</a> of <a
	href="http://codepoet-consulting.com/">CodePoet Consulting</a> to bid
    on your project.  If Erik is too busy to personally add your feature, there
    are several other active uClibc contributors who will almost certainly be able
    to help you out.  Erik can contact them and ask them about their availability.
