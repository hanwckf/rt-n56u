<h3>Mailing List Information</h3>
uClibc has a <a href="/lists/uclibc/">mailing list</a> for discussion and
development.  You can subscribe by visiting
<a href="http://codepoet.org/mailman/listinfo/uclibc">this page</a>.
Only subscribers to the uClibc mailing list are allowed to post
to this list.

<p>
There is also a mailing list for <a href="/lists/uclibc-cvs/">active developers</a>
wishing to read the complete diff of each and every change to uClibc -- not for the
faint of heart.  Active developers can subscribe by visiting
<a href="http://codepoet.org/mailman/listinfo/uclibc-cvs">this page</a>.
The Subversion server is the only one permtted to post to this list.  And yes,
this list name uses the word 'cvs' even though we don't use that anymore...

<p>


<h3>Search the List Archives</h3>
Please search the mailing list archives before asking questions on the mailing
list, since there is a good chance someone else has asked the same question
before.  Checking the archives is a great way to avoid annoying everyone on the
list with frequently asked questions...  You should also check the 
<a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a>, since the answer
you need may very well be listed there.
