	3. Mksquashfs now displays a progress bar.
	4. Squashfs kernel code has been hardened against accidently or
	   maliciously corrupted Squashfs filesystems.

3.1-r2	30 AUG 2006	Mksquashfs -sort bug fix

			A code optimisation after testing unfortunately
			broke sorting in Mksquashfs.  This has been fixed.

3.1	19 AUG 2006	This release has some major improvements to
			the squashfs-tools, a couple of major bug
			fixes, lots of small improvements/bug fixes,
			and new kernel patches.

			
	1. Mksquashfs has been rewritten to be multi-threaded.  It
	   has the following improvements

	   1.1. Parallel compression.  By default as many compression and
		fragment compression threads are created as there are available
		processors.  This significantly speeds up performance on SMP
		systems.
	   1.2. File input and filesystem output is peformed in parallel on
		separate threads to maximise I/O performance.  Even on single
		processor systems this speeds up performance by at least 10%.
	   1.3. Appending has been significantly improved, and files within the
		filesystem being appended to are no longer scanned and
		checksummed.  This significantly improves append time for large
		filesystems.
	   1.4. File duplicate checking has been optimised, and split into two
		separate phases.  Only files which are considered possible
		duplicates after the first phase are checksummed and cached in
		memory.
	   1.5	The use of swap memory was found to significantly impact
		performance. The amount of memory used to cache files is now a
		command line option, by default this is 512 Mbytes.
 
	2. Unsquashfs has the following improvements

	   2.1  Unsquashfs now allows you to specify the filename or the
		directory within the Squashfs filesystem that is to be
		extracted, rather than always extracting the entire filesystem.
	   2.2  A new -force option has been added which forces Unsquashfs to
		output to the destination directory even if files and directories
		already exist in the destination directory.  This allows you to
		update an already existing directory tree, or to Unsquashfs to
		a partially filled directory tree.  Without the -force option
		Unsquashfs will refuse to output.

	3.  The following major bug fixes have been made

	  3.1  	A fragment table rounding bug has been fixed in Mksquashfs.
		Previously if the number of fragments in the filesystem
		were a multiple of 512, Mksquashfs would generate an
		incorrect filesystem.
	  3.2  	A rare SMP bug which occurred when simultaneously acccessing
		multiply mounted Squashfs filesystems has been fixed.

	4. Miscellaneous improvements/bug fixes

	  4.1	Kernel code stack usage has been reduced.  This is to ensure
		Squashfs works with 4K stacks.
	  4.2   Readdir (Squashfs kernel code) has been fixed to always
		return 0, rather than the number of directories read.  Squashfs
		should now interact better with NFS.
	  4.3	Lseek bug in Mksquashfs when appending to larger than 4GB
		filesystems fixed.
	  4.4	Squashfs 2.x initrds can now been mounted.
	  4.5	Unsquashfs exit status fixed.
	  4.6	New patches for linux-2.6.18 and linux-2.4.33.

	
3.0	15 MAR 2006	Major filesystem improvements

	1. Filesystems are no longer limited to 4 GB.  In
	   theory 2^64 or 4 exabytes is now supported.
	2. Files are no longer limited to 4 GB.  In theory the maximum
	   file size is 4 exabytes.
	3. Metadata (inode table and directory tables) are no longer
	   restricted to 16 Mbytes.
	4. Hardlinks are now suppported.
	5. Nlink counts are now supported.
	6. Readdir now returns '.' and '..' entries.
	7. Special support for files larger than 256 MB has been added to
	   the Squashfs kernel code for faster read access.
	8. Inode numbers are now stored within the inode rather than being
	   computed from inode location on disk (this is not so much an
	   improvement, but a change forced by the previously listed
	   improvements).

2.2-r2	8 SEPT 2005	Second release of 2.2, this release fixes a couple
			of small bugs, a couple of small documentation
			mistakes, and adds a patch for kernel 2.6.13. 

	1. Mksquashfs now deletes the output filesystem image file if an
	   error occurs whilst generating the filesystem.  Previously on
	   error the image file was left empty or partially written.
	2. Updated mksquashfs so that it doesn't allow you to generate
	   filesystems with block sizes smaller than 4K.  Squashfs hasn't
	   supported block sizes less than 4K since 2.0-alpha.
	3. Mksquashfs now ignores missing files/directories in sort files.
	   This was the original behaviour before 2.2.
	4. Fixed small mistake in fs/Kconfig where the version was still
	   listed as 2.0.
	5. Updated ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS file.


2.2	3 JUL 2005	This release has some small improvements, bug fixes
			and patches for new kernels.

	1. Sort routine re-worked and debugged from release 2.1.  It now allows
	   you to give Mkisofs style sort files and checks for filenames that
	   don't match anything.  Sort priority has also been changed to
	   conform to Mkisofs usage, highest priority files are now placed
	   at the start of the filesystem (this means they will be on the
	   inside of a CD or DVD).
	2. New Configure options for embedded systems (memory constrained
	   systems).  See INSTALL file for further details.
	3. Directory index bug fixed where chars were treated as signed on
           some architectures.  A file would not be found in the rare case
	   that the filename started with a chracter greater than 127.
	4. Bug introduced into the read_data() routine when sped up to use data
	   block queueing fixed.  If the second or later block resulted in an
	   I/O error this was not checked.
	5. Append bug introduced in 2.1 fixed.  The code to compute the new
	   compressed and uncompressed directory parts after appending was
	   wrong.
	6. Metadata block length read routine altered to not perform a
	   misaligned short read.  This was to fix reading on an ARM7 running
	   uCLinux without a misaligned read interrupt handler.
	7. Checkdata bug introduced in 2.1 fixed.
	

2.1-r2  15 DEC 2004	Code changed so it can be compiled with gcc 2.x

	1.  In some of the code added for release 2.1 I unknowingly used some
	    gcc extensions only supported by 3.x compilers.  I have received
	    a couple of reports that the 2.1 release doesn't build on 2.x and so
	    people are clearly still using gcc 2.x.  The code has been
	    rewritten to remove these extensions.

2.1	10 DEC 2004	Significantly improved directory handling plus numerous
			other smaller improvements

	1.  Fast indexed directories implemented.  These speed up directory
	    operations (ls, file lookup etc.) significantly for directories
	    larger than 8 KB.
	2.  All directories are now sorted in alphabetical order.  This again
	    speeds up directory operations, and in some cases it also results in
	    a small compression improvement (greater data similarity between
	    files with alphabetically similar names).
	3.  Maximum directory size increased from 512 KB to 128 MB.
	4.  Duplicate fragment checking and appending optimised in mksquashfs,
	    depending on filesystem, this is now up to 25% faster.
	5.  Mksquashfs help information reformatted and reorganised.
	6.  The Squashfs version and release date is now printed at kernel
	    boot-time or module insertion.  This addition will hopefully help
	    to reduce the growing problem where the Squashfs version supported
	    by a kernel is unknown and the kernel source is unavailable.
        7.  New PERFORMANCE.README file.
	8.  New -2.0 mksquashfs option.
	9.  CHANGES file reorganised.
	10. README file reorganised, clarified and updated to include the 2.0
	    mksquashfs options.
	11. New patch for Linux 2.6.9.
	12. New patch for Linux 2.4.28.

2.0r2	29 AUG 2004	Workaround for kernel bug in kernels 2.6.8 and newer
			added

	1. New patch for kernel 2.6.8.1.  This includes a workaround for a
	   kernel bug introduced in 2.6.7bk14, which is present in all later
	   versions of the kernel.  

	   If you're using a 2.6.8 kernel or later then you must use this
	   2.6.8.1 patch.  If you've experienced hangs or oopses using Squashfs
	   with a 2.6.8 or later kernel then you've hit this bug, and this
	   patch will fix it.

	   It is worth mentioning that this kernel bug potentially affects
	   other filesystems.  If you receive odd results with other
	   filesystems you may be experiencing this bug with that filesystem.
	   I submitted a patch but this has not yet gone into the
	   kernel, hopefully the bug will be fixed in later kernels. 

2.0	13 JULY 2004	A couple of new options, and some bug fixes

	1. New mksquashfs -all-root, -root-owned, -force-uid, and -force-gid
	   options.  These allow the uids/gids of files in the generated
	   filesystem to be specified, overriding the uids/gids in the
	   source filesystem.
	2. Initrds are now supported for kernels 2.6.x.
	3. amd64 bug fixes.  If you use an amd64, please read the README-AMD64
	   file.
	4. Check-data and gid bug fixes.  With 2.0-alpha when mounting 1.x
	   filesystems in certain cases file gids were corrupted.
	5. New patch for Linux 2.6.7.

2.0-ALPHA	21 MAY 2004	Filesystem changes and compression improvements

	1. Squashfs 2.0 has added the concept of fragment blocks.
           Files smaller than the file block size and optionally the
	   remainder of files that do not fit fully into a block (i.e. the
	   last 32K in a 96K file) are packed into shared fragments and
	   compressed together.  This achieves on average 5 - 20% better
	   compression than Squashfs 1.x.
	2. The maximum block size has been increased to 64K (in the ALPHA
	   version of Squashfs 2.0).
	3. The maximum number of UIDs has been increased to 256 (from 48 in
	   1.x).
	4. The maximum number of GIDs has been increased to 256 (from 15 in
	   1.x).
	5. Removal of sleep_on() function call in 2.6.x patch, to allow Squashfs
	   to work on the Fedora rc2 kernel.
	6. Numerous small bug fixes have been made.

1.3r3	18 JAN 2004	Third release of 1.3, this adds a new mksquashfs option,
			some bug fixes, and extra patches for new kernels

	1. New mksquashfs -ef exclude option.  This option reads the exclude
	   dirs/files from an exclude file, one exclude dir/file per line.  This
	   avoids the command line size limit when using the -e exclude option,
	2. When appending to existing filesystems, if mksquashfs experiences a
	   fatal error (e.g. out of space when adding to the destination), the
	   original filesystem is restored,
	3. Mksquashfs now builds standalone, without the kernel needing to be
	   patched.
	4. Bug fix in the kernel squashfs filesystem, where the pages being
	   filled were not kmapped.  This seems to only have caused problems
	   on an Apple G5,
	5. New patch for Linux 2.4.24,

	6. New patch for Linux 2.6.1, this replaces the patch for 2.6.0-test7.

1.3r2	14 OCT 2003	Second release of 1.3, bug fixes and extra patches for
		        new kernels

	1. Bug fix in routine that adds files to the filesystem being
	   generated in mksquashfs.  This bug was introduced in 1.3
	   (not enough testing...) when I rewrote it to handle files larger
	   than available memory.  This bug caused a SEGV, so if you've ever
	   got that, it is now fixed,
	2. Long running bug where ls -s and du reported wrong block size
	   fixed.  I'm pretty sure this used to work many kernel versions ago
	   (2.4.7) but it broke somewhere along the line since then,
	3. New patch for Linux 2.4.22,
	4. New patch for 2.6.0-test7, this replaces the patch for 2.6.0-test1.

1.3	29 JUL 2003	FIFO/Socket support added plus optimisations and
		        improvements

	1. FIFOs and Socket inodes are now supported,
	2. Mksquashfs can now compress files larger than available
	   memory,
	3. File duplicate check routine optimised,
	4. Exit codes fixed in Mksquashfs,
	5. Patch for Linux 2.4.21,
	6. Patch for Linux 2.6.0-test1.  Hopefully, this will work for
	   the next few releases of 2.6.0-testx, otherwise, I'll be
	   releasing a lot of updates to the 2.6.0 patch...

1.2	13 MAR 2003	Append feature and new mksquashfs options added

	Mksquashfs can now add to existing squashfs filesystems.  Three extra
	options "-noappend", "-keep-as-directory", and "root-becomes"
	have been added.

	The append option with file duplicate detection, means squashfs can be
	used as a simple versioning archiving filesystem. A squashfs
	filesystem can be created with for example the linux-2.4.19 source.
	Appending the linux-2.4.20 source will create a filesystem with the
	two source trees, but only the changed files will take extra room,
	the unchanged files will be detected as duplicates.

	See the README file for usage changes.

1.1b	16 JAN 2003	Bug fix release

	Fixed readpage deadlock bug.  This was a rare deadlock bug that
	happened when pushing pages into the page cache when using greater
	than 4K blocks.  I never got this bug when I tested the filesystem,
	but two people emailed me on the same day about the problem!
	I fixed it by using a page cache function that wasn't there when
	I originally did the work, which was nice :-)

1.1	8 JAN 2003	Added features

	1. Kernel squashfs can now mount different byte order filesystems.
	2. Additional features added to mksquashfs.  Mksquashfs now supports
	   exclude files and multiple source files/directories can be
	   specified.  A nopad option has also been added, which
	   informs mksquashfs not to pad filesystems to a multiple of 4K.
	   See README for mksquashfs usage changes.
	3. Greater than 2GB filesystems bug fix.  Filesystems greater than 2GB
	   can now be created.

1.0c 	14 NOV 2002	Bug fix release

	Fixed bugs with initrds and device nodes

1.0 	23 OCT 2002	Initial release
