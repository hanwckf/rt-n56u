README

Inadyn is a simple and small DDNS client written in the C language.  DDNS is a popular
service for Internet users with dynamically allocated IP addresses.

If your ISP provides you with a DHCP or PPPoE/PPPoA connection you risk losing your
IP address every time you reconnect, or in DHCP even when the lease is renegotiated.

By using a DDNS client such as inadyn you can register an Internet name at certain
providers that the DDNS client updates, periodically and/or on demand when your IP
changes.

Inadyn can maintain multiple host names with the same IP address, and has a web based
IP detection which runs well behind a NAT router.

fee, but also provide more domains to choose from.

DDNS providers.  The following example config file illustrates how it can be used.
