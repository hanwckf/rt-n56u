.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Ip6tables
is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv6 packet
filter rules in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables
may be defined.  Each table contains a number of built-in
chains and may also contain user-defined chains.

Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each
rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.  This is called
a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same
table.

.SH TARGETS
A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet, and a target.  If the
packet does not match, the next rule in the chain is the examined; if
it does match, then the next rule is specified by the value of the
target, which can be the name of a user-defined chain or one of the
special values 
.IR ACCEPT ,
.IR DROP ,
.IR QUEUE ,
or
.IR RETURN .
.PP
.I ACCEPT 
means to let the packet through.
.I DROP
means to drop the packet on the floor.
.I QUEUE
means to pass the packet to userspace.  (How the packet can be received
by a userspace process differs by the particular queue handler.  2.4.x
and 2.6.x kernels up to 2.6.13 include the 
.B
ip_queue
queue handler.  Kernels 2.6.14 and later additionally include the 
.B
nfnetlink_queue
queue handler.  Packets with a target of QUEUE will be sent to queue number '0'
in this case. Please also see the
.B
NFQUEUE
target as described later in this man page.)
.I RETURN
means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the
previous (calling) chain.  If the end of a built-in chain is reached
or a rule in a built-in chain with target
.I RETURN
is matched, the target specified by the chain policy determines the
fate of the packet.
.SH TABLES
There are currently two independent tables (which tables are present
at any time depends on the kernel configuration options and which
modules are present), as nat table has not been implemented yet.
.TP
.BI "-t, --table " "table"
This option specifies the packet matching table which the command
should operate on.  If the kernel is configured with automatic module
loading, an attempt will be made to load the appropriate module for
that table if it is not already there.

The tables are as follows:
.RS
.TP .4i
.BR "filter" :
This is the default table (if no -t option is passed).  It contains
the built-in chains
.B INPUT
(for packets coming into the box itself),
.B FORWARD
(for packets being routed through the box), and
.B OUTPUT
(for locally-generated packets).
.TP
.BR "mangle" :
This table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel
2.4.17 it had two built-in chains:
.B PREROUTING
(for altering incoming packets before routing) and
.B OUTPUT
(for altering locally-generated packets before routing).
Since kernel 2.4.18, three other built-in chains are also supported:
.B INPUT
(for packets coming into the box itself),
.B FORWARD
(for altering packets being routed through the box), and
.B POSTROUTING
(for altering packets as they are about to go out).
.TP
.BR "raw" :
This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection
tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target.  It registers at the netfilter
hooks with higher priority and is thus called before nf_conntrack, or any other
IP6 tables.  It provides the following built-in chains:
.B PREROUTING
(for packets arriving via any network interface)
.B OUTPUT
(for packets generated by local processes)
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
The options that are recognized by
.B ip6tables
can be divided into several different groups.
.SS COMMANDS
These options specify the specific action to perform.  Only one of them
can be specified on the command line unless otherwise specified
below.  For all the long versions of the command and option names, you
need to use only enough letters to ensure that
.B ip6tables
can differentiate it from all other options.
.TP
.BI "-A, --append " "chain rule-specification"
Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain.
When the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one
address, a rule will be added for each possible address combination.
.TP
.BI "-D, --delete " "chain rule-specification"
.ns
.TP
.BI "-D, --delete " "chain rulenum"
Delete one or more rules from the selected chain.  There are two
versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a number in the
chain (starting at 1 for the first rule) or a rule to match.
.TP
.B "-I, --insert"
Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule
number.  So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are inserted
at the head of the chain.  This is also the default if no rule number
is specified.
.TP
.BI "-R, --replace " "chain rulenum rule-specification"
Replace a rule in the selected chain.  If the source and/or
destination names resolve to multiple addresses, the command will
fail.  Rules are numbered starting at 1.
.TP
.BR "-L, --list " "[\fIchain\fP]"
List all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected, all
chains are listed.  As every other iptables command, it applies to the
specified table (filter is the default), so mangle rules get listed by
.nf
 ip6tables -t mangle -n -L
.fi
Please note that it is often used with the
.B -n
option, in order to avoid long reverse DNS lookups.
It is legal to specify the
.B -Z
(zero) option as well, in which case the chain(s) will be atomically
listed and zeroed.  The exact output is affected by the other
arguments given. The exact rules are suppressed until you use
.nf
 ip6tables -L -v
.fi
.TP
.BR "-F, --flush " "[\fIchain\fP]"
Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is given).
This is equivalent to deleting all the rules one by one.
.TP
.BR "-Z, --zero " "[\fIchain\fP]"
Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains.  It is legal to
specify the
.B "-L, --list"
(list) option as well, to see the counters immediately before they are
cleared. (See above.)
.TP
.BI "-N, --new-chain " "chain"
Create a new user-defined chain by the given name.  There must be no
target of that name already.
.TP
.BR "-X, --delete-chain " "[\fIchain\fP]"
Delete the optional user-defined chain specified.  There must be no references
to the chain.  If there are, you must delete or replace the referring
rules before the chain can be deleted.  If no argument is given, it
will attempt to delete every non-builtin chain in the table.
.TP
.BI "-P, --policy " "chain target"
Set the policy for the chain to the given target.  See the section
.B TARGETS
for the legal targets.  Only built-in (non-user-defined) chains can have
policies, and neither built-in nor user-defined chains can be policy
targets.
.TP
.BI "-E, --rename-chain " "old-chain new-chain"
Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.  This is
cosmetic, and has no effect on the structure of the table.
.TP
.B -h
Help.
Give a (currently very brief) description of the command syntax.
.SS PARAMETERS
The following parameters make up a rule specification (as used in the
add, delete, insert, replace and append commands).
.TP
.BR "-p, --protocol " "[!] \fIprotocol\fP"
The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check.
The specified protocol can be one of
.IR tcp ,
.IR udp ,
.IR icmpv6 ,
.IR esp ,
.IR all ,
or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a
different one. A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed.
But IPv6 extension headers except
.IR esp
are not allowed.
.IR esp ,
and
.IR ipv6-nonext
can be used with Kernel version 2.6.11 or later.
A "!" argument before the protocol inverts the
test.  The number zero is equivalent to
.IR all .
Protocol
.I all
will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this
option is omitted.
.TP
.BR "-s, --source " "[!] \fIaddress\fP[/\fImask\fP]"
Source specification.
.I Address
can be either a hostname (please note that specifying
any name to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea),
a network IPv6 address (with /mask), or a plain IPv6 address.
(the network name isn't supported now).
The
.I mask
can be either a network mask or a plain number,
specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask.
Thus, a mask of
.I 64
is equivalent to
.IR ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000 .
A "!" argument before the address specification inverts the sense of
the address. The flag
.B --src
is an alias for this option.
.TP
.BR "-d, --destination " "[!] \fIaddress\fP[/\fImask\fP]"
Destination specification. 
See the description of the
.B -s
(source) flag for a detailed description of the syntax.  The flag
.B --dst
is an alias for this option.
.TP
.BI "-j, --jump " "target"
This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the packet
matches it.  The target can be a user-defined chain (other than the
one this rule is in), one of the special builtin targets which decide
the fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see
.B EXTENSIONS
below).  If this
option is omitted in a rule, then matching the rule will have no
effect on the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be
incremented.
.TP
.BR "-i, --in-interface " "[!] \fIname\fP"
Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be received (only for
packets entering the 
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B PREROUTING
chains).  When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the
sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match.  If this option is
omitted, any interface name will match.
.TP
.BR "-o, --out-interface " "[!] \fIname\fP"
Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets
entering the
.BR FORWARD 
and
.B OUTPUT
chains).  When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the
sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match.  If this option is
omitted, any interface name will match.
.TP
.\" Currently not supported (header-based)
.\" 
.\" .B "[!] " "-f, --fragment"
.\" This means that the rule only refers to second and further fragments
.\" of fragmented packets.  Since there is no way to tell the source or
.\" destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will
.\" not match any rules which specify them.  When the "!" argument
.\" precedes the "-f" flag, the rule will only match head fragments, or
.\" unfragmented packets.
.\" .TP
.B "-c, --set-counters " "PKTS BYTES"
This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte
counters of a rule (during
.B INSERT,
.B APPEND,
.B REPLACE
operations).
.SS "OTHER OPTIONS"
The following additional options can be specified:
.TP
.B "-v, --verbose"
Verbose output.  This option makes the list command show the interface
name, the rule options (if any), and the TOS masks.  The packet and
byte counters are also listed, with the suffix 'K', 'M' or 'G' for
1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers respectively (but see
the
.B -x
flag to change this).
For appending, insertion, deletion and replacement, this causes
detailed information on the rule or rules to be printed.
.TP
.B "-n, --numeric"
Numeric output.
IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format.
By default, the program will try to display them as host names,
network names, or services (whenever applicable).
.TP
.B "-x, --exact"
Expand numbers.
Display the exact value of the packet and byte counters,
instead of only the rounded number in K's (multiples of 1000)
M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1000M).  This option is
only relevant for the 
.B -L
command.
.TP
.B "--line-numbers"
When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule,
corresponding to that rule's position in the chain.
.TP
.B "--modprobe=command"
When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use
.B command
to load any necessary modules (targets, match extensions, etc).
.SH MATCH EXTENSIONS
ip6tables can use extended packet matching modules.  These are loaded
in two ways: implicitly, when
.B -p
or
.B --protocol
is specified, or with the
.B -m
or
.B --match
options, followed by the matching module name; after these, various
extra command line options become available, depending on the specific
module.  You can specify multiple extended match modules in one line,
and you can use the
.B -h
or
.B --help
options after the module has been specified to receive help specific
to that module.

The following are included in the base package, and most of these can
be preceded by a
.B !
to invert the sense of the match.
.\" @MATCH@
.SS ah
This module matches the parameters in Authentication header of IPsec packets.
.TP
.BR "--ahspi " "[!] \fIspi\fP[:\fIspi\fP]"
Matches SPI.
.TP
.BR "--ahlen " "[!] \fIlength"
Total length of this header in octets.
.TP
.BI "--ahres"
Matches if the reserved field is filled with zero.
.SS condition
This matches if a specific /proc filename is '0' or '1'.
.TP
.BR "--condition " "[!] \fIfilename"
Match on boolean value stored in /proc/net/ip6t_condition/filename file
.SS dst
This module matches the parameters in Destination Options header
.TP
.BR "--dst-len " "[!] \fIlength"
Total length of this header in octets.

.SS esp
This module matches the SPIs in ESP header of IPsec packets.
.TP
.BR "--espspi " "[!] \fIspi\fP[:\fIspi\fP]"
.SS eui64
This module matches the EUI-64 part of a stateless autoconfigured IPv6 address.
It compares the EUI-64 derived from the source MAC address in Ethernet frame
with the lower 64 bits of the IPv6 source address. But "Universal/Local"
bit is not compared. This module doesn't match other link layer frame, and
is only valid in the
.BR PREROUTING ,
.BR INPUT
and
.BR FORWARD
chains.
.SS frag
This module matches the parameters in Fragment header.
.TP
.BR "--fragid " "[!] \fIid\fP[:\fIid\fP]"
Matches the given Identification or range of it.
.TP
.BR "--fraglen " "[!] \fIlength\fP"
This option cannot be used with kernel version 2.6.10 or later. The length of
Fragment header is static and this option doesn't make sense.
.TP
.BR "--fragres "
Matches if the reserved fields are filled with zero.
.TP
.BR "--fragfirst "
Matches on the first fragment.
.TP
.BR "[--fragmore]"
Matches if there are more fragments.
.TP
.BR "[--fraglast]"
Matches if this is the last fragement.
.SS hbh
This module matches the parameters in Hop-by-Hop Options header
.TP
.BR "--hbh-len " "[!] \fIlength\fP"
Total length of this header in octets.
.TP
.BR "--hbh-opts " "\fItype\fP[:\fIlength\fP][,\fItype\fP[:\fIlength\fP]...]"
numeric type of option and the length of the option data in octets.
.SS hl
This module matches the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header.
.TP
.BR "--hl-eq " "[!] \fIvalue\fP"
Matches if Hop Limit equals \fIvalue\fP.
.TP
.BI "--hl-lt " "value"
Matches if Hop Limit is less than \fIvalue\fP.
.TP
.BI "--hl-gt " "value"
Matches if Hop Limit is greater than \fIvalue\fP.
.SS icmp6
This extension can be used if `--protocol ipv6-icmp' or `--protocol icmpv6' is
specified. It provides the following option:
.TP
.BR "--icmpv6-type " "[!] \fItype\fP[/\fIcode\fP]|\fItypename\fP"
This allows specification of the ICMPv6 type, which can be a numeric
ICMPv6
.IR type ,
.IR type
and
.IR code ,
or one of the ICMPv6 type names shown by the command
.nf
 ip6tables -p ipv6-icmp -h
.fi
.SS ipv6header
This module matches IPv6 extension headers and/or upper layer header.
.TP
.BR "--header " "[!] \fIheader\fP[,\fIheader\fP...]"
Matches the packet which EXACTLY includes all specified headers. The headers
encapsulated with ESP header are out of scope.
.IR header
can be
.IR hop | hop-by-hop
(Hop-by-Hop Options header),
.IR dst
(Destination Options header),
.IR route
(Routing header),
.IR frag
(Fragment header),
.IR auth
(Authentication header),
.IR esp
(Encapsulating Security Payload header),
.IR none
(No Next header) which matches 59 in the 'Next Header field' of IPv6 header or any IPv6 extension headers, or
.IR proto
which matches any upper layer protocol header. A protocol name from /etc/protocols and numeric value also allowed. The number 255 is equivalent to
.IR proto .
.TP
.BR "[--soft]"
Matches if the packet includes all specified headers with
.BR --header ,
AT LEAST.
.SS length
This module matches the length of the IPv6 payload in octets, or range of it.
IPv6 header itself isn't counted.
.TP
.BR "--length " "[!] \fIlength\fP[:\fIlength\fP]"
.SS limit
This module matches at a limited rate using a token bucket filter.
A rule using this extension will match until this limit is reached
(unless the `!' flag is used).  It can be used in combination with the
.B LOG
target to give limited logging, for example.
.TP
.BI "--limit " "rate"
Maximum average matching rate: specified as a number, with an optional
`/second', `/minute', `/hour', or `/day' suffix; the default is
3/hour.
.TP
.BI "--limit-burst " "number"
Maximum initial number of packets to match: this number gets
recharged by one every time the limit specified above is not reached,
up to this number; the default is 5.
.SS mac
.TP
.BR "--mac-source " "[!] \fIaddress\fP"
Match source MAC address.  It must be of the form XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
Note that this only makes sense for packets coming from an Ethernet device
and entering the
.BR PREROUTING ,
.B FORWARD
or
.B INPUT
chains.
.SS mark
This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a packet
(which can be set using the
.B MARK
target below).
.TP
.BR "--mark " "\fIvalue\fP[/\fImask\fP]"
Matches packets with the given unsigned mark value (if a \fImask\fP is
specified, this is logically ANDed with the \fImask\fP before the
comparison).
.SS mh
This extension is loaded if `--protocol ipv6-mh' or `--protocol mh' is
specified. It provides the following option:
.TP
.BR "--mh-type " "[!] \fItype\fP[:\fItype\fP]"
This allows specification of the Mobility Header(MH) type, which can be
a numeric MH
.IR type ,
.IR type
or one of the MH type names shown by the command
.nf
 ip6tables -p ipv6-mh -h
.fi
.SS multiport
This module matches a set of source or destination ports.  Up to 15
ports can be specified.  It can only be used in conjunction
with
.B "-p tcp"
or
.BR "-p udp" .
.TP
.BR "--source-ports " "\fI[!] port\fP[,\fIport\fP[,\fIport\fP...]]"
Match if the source port is one of the given ports.  The flag
.B --sports
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
.BR "--destination-ports " "\fI[!] port\fP[,\fIport\fP[,\fIport\fP...]]"
Match if the destination port is one of the given ports.  The flag
.B --dports
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
.BR "--ports " "\fI[!] port\fP[,\fIport\fP[,\fIport\fP...]]"
Match if the both the source and destination ports are equal to each
other and to one of the given ports.
.SS owner
This module attempts to match various characteristics of the packet
creator, for locally-generated packets.  It is only valid in the
.B OUTPUT
chain, and even this some packets (such as ICMPv6 ping responses) may
have no owner, and hence never match.  This is regarded as experimental.
.TP
.BI "--uid-owner " "userid"
Matches if the packet was created by a process with the given
effective user id.
.TP
.BI "--gid-owner " "groupid"
Matches if the packet was created by a process with the given
effective group id.
.TP
.BI "--pid-owner " "processid"
Matches if the packet was created by a process with the given
process id.
.TP
.BI "--sid-owner " "sessionid"
Matches if the packet was created by a process in the given session
group.
.TP
.B NOTE: pid, sid and command matching are broken on SMP
.SS physdev
This module matches on the bridge port input and output devices enslaved
to a bridge device. This module is a part of the infrastructure that enables
a transparent bridging IP firewall and is only useful for kernel versions
above version 2.5.44.
.TP
.BR --physdev-in " [!] \fIname\fP"
Name of a bridge port via which a packet is received (only for
packets entering the
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B PREROUTING
chains). If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match. If the packet didn't arrive
through a bridge device, this packet won't match this option, unless '!' is used.
.TP
.BR --physdev-out " [!] \fIname\fP"
Name of a bridge port via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets
entering the
.BR FORWARD ,
.B OUTPUT
and
.B POSTROUTING
chains).  If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match. Note that in the
.BR nat " and " mangle
.B OUTPUT
chains one cannot match on the bridge output port, however one can in the
.B "filter OUTPUT"
chain. If the packet won't leave by a bridge device or it is yet unknown what
the output device will be, then the packet won't match this option, unless
'!' is used.
.TP
.RB "[!] " --physdev-is-in
Matches if the packet has entered through a bridge interface.
.TP
.RB "[!] " --physdev-is-out
Matches if the packet will leave through a bridge interface.
.TP
.RB "[!] " --physdev-is-bridged
Matches if the packet is being bridged and therefore is not being routed.
This is only useful in the FORWARD and POSTROUTING chains.
.SS policy
This modules matches the policy used by IPsec for handling a packet.
.TP
.BI "--dir " "in|out"
Used to select whether to match the policy used for decapsulation or the
policy that will be used for encapsulation.
.B in
is valid in the
.B PREROUTING, INPUT and FORWARD
chains,
.B out
is valid in the
.B POSTROUTING, OUTPUT and FORWARD
chains.
.TP
.BI "--pol " "none|ipsec"
Matches if the packet is subject to IPsec processing.
.TP
.BI "--strict"
Selects whether to match the exact policy or match if any rule of
the policy matches the given policy.
.TP
.BI "--reqid " "id"
Matches the reqid of the policy rule. The reqid can be specified with
.B setkey(8)
using
.B unique:id
as level.
.TP
.BI "--spi " "spi"
Matches the SPI of the SA.
.TP
.BI "--proto " "ah|esp|ipcomp"
Matches the encapsulation protocol.
.TP
.BI "--mode " "tunnel|transport"
Matches the encapsulation mode.
.TP
.BI "--tunnel-src " "addr[/mask]"
Matches the source end-point address of a tunnel mode SA.
Only valid with --mode tunnel.
.TP
.BI "--tunnel-dst " "addr[/mask]"
Matches the destination end-point address of a tunnel mode SA.
Only valid with --mode tunnel.
.TP
.BI "--next"
Start the next element in the policy specification. Can only be used with
--strict
.SS rt
Match on IPv6 routing header
.TP
.BR "--rt-type" " [!] \fItype\fP"
Match the type (numeric).
.TP
.BR "--rt-segsleft" " [!] \fInum\fP[:\fInum\fP]"
Match the `segments left' field (range).
.TP
.BR "--rt-len" " [!] \fIlength\fP"
Match the length of this header.
.TP
.BR "--rt-0-res"
Match the reserved field, too (type=0)
.TP
.BR "--rt-0-addrs" " \fIADDR\fP[,\fIADDR\fP...]"
Match type=0 addresses (list).
.TP
.BR "--rt-0-not-strict"
List of type=0 addresses is not a strict list.
.SS tcp
These extensions can be used if `--protocol tcp' is specified. It
provides the following options:
.TP
.BR "--source-port " "[!] \fIport\fP[:\fIport\fP]"
Source port or port range specification. This can either be a service
name or a port number. An inclusive range can also be specified,
using the format
.IR port : port .
If the first port is omitted, "0" is assumed; if the last is omitted,
"65535" is assumed.
If the second port greater then the first they will be swapped.
The flag
.B --sport
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
.BR "--destination-port " "[!] \fIport\fP[:\fIport\fP]"
Destination port or port range specification.  The flag
.B --dport
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
.BR "--tcp-flags " "[!] \fImask\fP \fIcomp\fP"
Match when the TCP flags are as specified.  The first argument is the
flags which we should examine, written as a comma-separated list, and
the second argument is a comma-separated list of flags which must be
set.  Flags are: 
.BR "SYN ACK FIN RST URG PSH ALL NONE" .
Hence the command
.nf
 ip6tables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST SYN
.fi
will only match packets with the SYN flag set, and the ACK, FIN and
RST flags unset.
.TP
.B "[!] --syn"
Only match TCP packets with the SYN bit set and the ACK and RST bits
cleared.  Such packets are used to request TCP connection initiation;
for example, blocking such packets coming in an interface will prevent
incoming TCP connections, but outgoing TCP connections will be
unaffected.
It is equivalent to \fB--tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN\fP.
If the "!" flag precedes the "--syn", the sense of the
option is inverted.
.TP
.BR "--tcp-option " "[!] \fInumber\fP"
Match if TCP option set.
.SS udp
These extensions can be used if `--protocol udp' is specified.  It
provides the following options:
.TP
.BR "--source-port " "[!] \fIport\fP[:\fIport\fP]"
Source port or port range specification.
See the description of the
.B --source-port
option of the TCP extension for details.
.TP
.BR "--destination-port " "[!] \fIport\fP[:\fIport\fP]"
Destination port or port range specification.
See the description of the
.B --destination-port
option of the TCP extension for details.
.SH TARGET EXTENSIONS
ip6tables can use extended target modules: the following are included
in the standard distribution.
.\" @TARGET@
.SS CONNSECMARK
This module copies security markings from packets to connections
(if unlabeled), and from connections back to packets (also only
if unlabeled).  Typically used in conjunction with SECMARK, it is
only valid in the
.B mangle
table.
.TP
.B --save
If the packet has a security marking, copy it to the connection
if the connection is not marked.
.TP
.B --restore
If the packet does not have a security marking, and the connection
does, copy the security marking from the connection to the packet.

.SS HL
This is used to modify the Hop Limit field in IPv6 header. The Hop Limit field
is similar to what is known as TTL value in IPv4.  Setting or incrementing the
Hop Limit field can potentially be very dangerous, so it should be avoided at
any cost. This target is only valid in
.B mangle
table.
.TP
.B Don't ever set or increment the value on packets that leave your local network!
.TP
.BI "--hl-set " "value"
Set the Hop Limit to `value'.
.TP
.BI "--hl-dec " "value"
Decrement the Hop Limit `value' times.
.TP
.BI "--hl-inc " "value"
Increment the Hop Limit `value' times.
.SS LOG
Turn on kernel logging of matching packets.  When this option is set
for a rule, the Linux kernel will print some information on all
matching packets (like most IPv6 IPv6-header fields) via the kernel log
(where it can be read with
.I dmesg
or 
.IR syslogd (8)).
This is a "non-terminating target", i.e. rule traversal continues at
the next rule.  So if you want to LOG the packets you refuse, use two
separate rules with the same matching criteria, first using target LOG
then DROP (or REJECT).
.TP
.BI "--log-level " "level"
Level of logging (numeric or see \fIsyslog.conf\fP(5)).
.TP
.BI "--log-prefix " "prefix"
Prefix log messages with the specified prefix; up to 29 letters long,
and useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.
.TP
.B --log-tcp-sequence
Log TCP sequence numbers. This is a security risk if the log is
readable by users.
.TP
.B --log-tcp-options
Log options from the TCP packet header.
.TP
.B --log-ip-options
Log options from the IPv6 packet header.
.TP
.B --log-uid
Log the userid of the process which generated the packet.
.SS MARK
This is used to set the netfilter mark value associated with the
packet.  It is only valid in the
.B mangle
table.
.TP
.BI "--set-mark " "mark"
.SS NFQUEUE
This target is an extension of the QUEUE target. As opposed to QUEUE, it allows
you to put a packet into any specific queue, identified by its 16-bit queue
number.  
.TP
.BR "--queue-num " "\fIvalue"
This specifies the QUEUE number to use. Valud queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 0.
.TP
It can only be used with Kernel versions 2.6.14 or later, since it requires
the
.B
nfnetlink_queue
kernel support.
.SS REJECT
This is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched
packet: otherwise it is equivalent to 
.B DROP
so it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal.
This target is only valid in the
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B OUTPUT
chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
chains.  The following option controls the nature of the error packet
returned:
.TP
.BI "--reject-with " "type"
The type given can be
.nf
.B " icmp6-no-route"
.B " no-route"
.B " icmp6-adm-prohibited"
.B " adm-prohibited"
.B " icmp6-addr-unreachable"
.B " addr-unreach"
.B " icmp6-port-unreachable"
.B " port-unreach"
.fi
which return the appropriate ICMPv6 error message (\fBport-unreach\fP is
the default). Finally, the option
.B tcp-reset
can be used on rules which only match the TCP protocol: this causes a
TCP RST packet to be sent back.  This is mainly useful for blocking 
.I ident
(113/tcp) probes which frequently occur when sending mail to broken mail
hosts (which won't accept your mail otherwise).
.B tcp-reset
can only be used with kernel versions 2.6.14 or latter.

.SS SECMARK
This is used to set the security mark value associated with the
packet for use by security subsystems such as SELinux.  It is only
valid in the
.B mangle
table.
.TP
.BI "--selctx " "security_context"
.SS TCPMSS
This target allows to alter the MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control
the maximum size for that connection (usually limiting it to your
outgoing interface's MTU minus 60).  Of course, it can only be used
in conjunction with
.BR "-p tcp" .
It is only valid in the
.BR mangle
table.
.br
This target is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers
which block ICMPv6 Packet Too Big packets or are unable to send them.
The symptoms of this problem are that everything works fine from your 
Linux firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
packets:
.PD 0
.RS 0.1i
.TP 0.3i
1)
Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
.TP
2)
Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
.TP
3)
ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.
.RE
.PD
Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
configuration like:
.nf
 ip6tables -t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \\
             -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
.fi
.TP
.BI "--set-mss " "value"
Explicitly set MSS option to specified value.
.TP
.B "--clamp-mss-to-pmtu"
Automatically clamp MSS value to (path_MTU - 60).
.TP
These options are mutually exclusive.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Various error messages are printed to standard error.  The exit code
is 0 for correct functioning.  Errors which appear to be caused by
invalid or abused command line parameters cause an exit code of 2, and
other errors cause an exit code of 1.
.SH BUGS
Bugs?  What's this? ;-)
Well... the counters are not reliable on sparc64.
.SH COMPATIBILITY WITH IPCHAINS
This 
.B ip6tables
is very similar to ipchains by Rusty Russell.  The main difference is
that the chains 
.B INPUT
and
.B OUTPUT
are only traversed for packets coming into the local host and
originating from the local host respectively.  Hence every packet only
passes through one of the three chains (except loopback traffic, which
involves both INPUT and OUTPUT chains); previously a forwarded packet
would pass through all three.
.PP
The other main difference is that 
.B -i
refers to the input interface;
.B -o
refers to the output interface, and both are available for packets
entering the
.B FORWARD
chain.
.\" .PP The various forms of NAT have been separated out; 
.\" .B iptables 
.\" is a pure packet filter when using the default `filter' table, with
.\" optional extension modules.  This should simplify much of the previous
.\" confusion over the combination of IP masquerading and packet filtering
.\" seen previously.  So the following options are handled differently:
.\" .br
.\" -j MASQ
.\" .br
.\" -M -S
.\" .br
.\" -M -L
.\" .br
There are several other changes in ip6tables.
